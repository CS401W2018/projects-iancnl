        <h3>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS</h3>
        <p>Inline CSS: Applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute.</p>
        <p>Embedded CSS: Placed within a style tag inside the HTML head. Affects multiple elements in the same document.</p>
        <p>External CSS: Stored in a separate .css file and linked using link. Best for maintaining consistency across multiple pages.</p>
        <h3>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h3>
        <p>External CSS is the best choice because it keeps HTML clean, improves maintainability, and ensures consistency across multiple pages.
        It also enhances performance by allowing browsers to cache styles, reducing page load time. Additionally, it makes collaboration easier and separates content from design, following best coding practices.</p>
        <h3>What is a selector used for?</h3>
        <p>A selector is used in CSS to target and style specific HTML elements. It defines which elements the styles will apply to based on their tag name, class, ID, attributes, or relationships to other elements.</p>
