            <h1>Welcome to Hong Kong Tour!</h1>
            <p>Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. With 7.4 million residents of various nationalities in a 1,104-square-kilometre (426 sq mi) territory,
                <br>Hong Kong is the fourth most densely populated region in the world.
                <br>Hong Kong was established as a colony of the British Empire after the Qing dynasty ceded Hong Kong Island in 1841-1842 as a consequence of losing the First Opium War.
                <br>The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and was further extended when the United Kingdom obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898.
                <br>Hong Kong was occupied by Japan from 1941 to 1945 during World War II. The territory was handed over from the United Kingdom to China in 1997.
                <br>Hong Kong maintains separate governing and economic systems from that of mainland China under the principle of one country, two systems.
                <br>
                <br>Hong Kong is my home town. I miss the food, friends and family. In this tour I will bring you to different tour places in Hong Kong. Enjoy the tour and if you interest in visiting Hong Kong, Please don't hesitate to visit.
