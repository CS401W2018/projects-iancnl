            <p>Skydiving is often associated with excitement and freedom, but it&#39;s natural to wonder about its risks. 
            <br>While it is an extreme sport with potential dangers like parachute malfunctions or hard landings, modern safety measures, 
            <br>training, and technology have greatly minimized these risks. Like any activity, smart decisions and proper precautions go a long way.
            <br>Ultimately, the biggest risk might just be falling in love with the thrill of skydiving!
