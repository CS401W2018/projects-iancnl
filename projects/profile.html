    <h3>I serve my mission in <mark><Strong><var>&lt;Hong Kong&gt;</var></Strong></mark></h3>
    <br><P></P>I was called to England Bramingham mission, but I served in Hong Kong because of the Covid 19. I was served as Zone leader, Distirct leader and an Office Elder at the same time. So, I was working under so much pressure. I do have my favorite ward that I served and I rank them from 1-3.
